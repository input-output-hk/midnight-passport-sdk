# Compatibility matrix

> **Status:** live · updated 2026/10/15. Releases are lockstep across the
> `@input-output-hk/mn-passport-*` packages. The binding data is pinned in
> `packages/contract/acc-binding-v2.generated.json` and the generated registry.

## Binding axis

| SDK | ACC binding | Passport source | Compiler | Language | Runtime (`@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime`) | Compiler manifest SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0.1.0-rc1` | `acc-s3r1.1` | `6458ed5` (P-256 plus caller-pinned grants) | 0.35.0 | 0.27.0 | 0.20.0 | `77fb9c17b0d59047456c43115d9a58f5cb99a226ee73b6b974fd724930c3153f` |

The package registry supports only `acc-s3r1.1`. The older provisional
`0.0.0-prototype.1` binding is retired. The separate `acc-45721e1` key bundle
remains in `mn-passport-contract` for prototype archive work, but the SDK does
not deploy or resolve it. All supported bindings in this release use the same
Compact runtime.

## API axis

| SDK | Account API (`PASSPORT_API_VERSION`) | Service API (`PASSPORT_SERVICE_API_VERSION`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0.1.0-rc1` | `1.0.0-pre.0` | `1.0.0-pre.0` |

The local demo service is not a published SDK package. The service API constant
names the versioned client wire types; the demo still uses its prototype routes.

## Lace consumer seam check

The fixture in `tests/fixtures/lace-seams.mjs` tracks
[lace-platform PR #2845](https://github.com/input-output-hk/lace-platform/pull/2845)
at head `05e1e3d641a329d20c8272f6405e54ea499d86a1` (2026/10/15), from
`packages/contract/passport/src/types.ts`. `tests/account-ports.test.mjs` checks
the structural TypeScript assignments. This is a seam check against the PR's
types, not a packed-package Lace build or live transaction test.

| Lace seam | SDK port | Current result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FeeSponsor.balanceAndSign` | `FeeSponsor` | Direct structural assignment |
| `PassportEncryptionKey` | `AccountViewingKey` | Direct structural assignment for reader, keyring, inbox, and grant operations |
| `PassportNetworkConfig` | `NetworkConfig` | Lace network fields fit; the SDK caller must supply its additional ACC binding and manifest pins |
| `PassportAuthoriser` | `Authoriser` | Needs a boundary adapter for branded account/counter/epoch values and key-session flows |
| `PassportProver.prove/check` | transaction `Prover.proveTx` | Different abstraction: Lace proves a circuit preimage; a transaction pipeline must wrap it |

The current Lace `KeySessionFlow.kind` omits `rotate-encryption-key`, which the
SDK's owner flow requests. The test adapter rejects this operation until Lace and
the SDK agree on its consent descriptor. Other Lace flow kinds include grants
and holdings, which the SDK's current owner API has not yet implemented. This
is an integration gap, not permission to run rotation without a key session.

The older SDK `EncryptionKeySource.publicKey` port is a prototype key source;
Lace's `PassportEncryptionKey` matches the newer `AccountViewingKey` instead.
The next release must validate a packed SDK consumer against Lace's current
types and complete the required owner/circuit flows before claiming full Lace
compatibility.

## Axes and releases

Added 2026/10/08 ([ADR 0006](./adr/0006-publish-on-github-packages.md),
[ADR 0007](./adr/0007-package-set-ports-and-flows.md); publishing design
[§3.5 and §6.5](./superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-passport-sdk-packages-design.md)).
The account API and the service wire types are versioned separately.

| Axis | What it versions | Where | Breaking change means |
|---|---|---|---|
| API | The account API, descriptor, error codes and progress events (`PASSPORT_API_VERSION`); the service's HTTP wire (`PASSPORT_SERVICE_API_VERSION`, path prefix `/v1`) | `mn-passport-protocol` | A removed or changed member, field, code meaning or endpoint |
| Binding | The deployed ACC's circuit shape: binding id, manifest hash, Compact runtime | `mn-passport-contract` registry; `mn-passport-account` support | Dropping a binding, or moving the Compact runtime (all bindings in a release share one, FS-0.9 D-6) |

- **Lockstep.** Every `@input-output-hk/mn-passport-*` package shares one version
  per release. A major bump on either axis is a major release. A minor
  release may add optional fields, methods, error codes, progress steps,
  endpoints and bindings. A patch changes no contract.
- **A new binding is a minor release of every package.** The contract package
  gains the artefact and its registry entry (manifest hash committed, ADR
  0004), the account package gains its catalogue entries, and the matrix gains
  a row, in one release.
- **Before 1.0** releases are `0.y.z`: a minor may break, a patch may only add.
  1.0.0 is cut when lace-platform integrates.
- **Binding ids** follow FS-0.9 D-5: `acc-s<spec_version>r<recovery_version>.<n>`.
- **The release matrix** has one row per release.

| SDK | API version | Service API version | Supported bindings | Binding for new accounts | Compact runtime | Midnight package set |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0.1.0-rc1` | `1.0.0-pre.0` | `1.0.0-pre.0` | `acc-s3r1.1` | `acc-s3r1.1` | `0.20.0` | midnight-js `5.0.0-rc.2`, ledger-v9 `1.0.0-rc.5` |

The release row records the RC1 package API and pinned grants binding. The
service library and JubJub authoriser were not part of RC1; development toward
the next release is tracked separately from this published release row.
